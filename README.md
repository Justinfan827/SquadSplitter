# SquadSplitter
App to help squads split costs

Initial brainstorm:
Camera screen
One person takes picture of receipt:
- Add names to the current table

Listing friends screen
- After listing: 2 possible flows:
- Manually select
- Or split evenly

(split evenly skips this screen)
Tagging receipt screen: 
- go through each item on the receipt 
- drag names to see who ate what item
- Add everyone button 
- Next item button 
- Note: 

Confirmation screen
- Items listed with icons 
- Pop up modal

modal for item pop up

Assuming receipt parsing works


Iteration 1: receipt parsing
- split the cost evenly across listed people.
- List names and the cost they owe
- Screens: camera screen, listing friends, confirmation screen

Iteration 2: 
- Able to add names to receipt items that have been parsed by receipt API
- Be able to manually choose who eats what and split accordingly

Potential features:
- Tip adding: divided according to ratios of cost
- Geolocation: identify which friends are near you to suggest people to add. 
    - Value: reduce need to type.
- Portion divider: select how much of food you ate
- Previous squads: history of tables/squads
-
